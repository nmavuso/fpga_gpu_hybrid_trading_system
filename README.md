# FPGA-GPU Hybrid System for Ultra-Low Latency High-Frequency Trading (HFT)

## Overview
This project implements an **ultra-low latency high-frequency trading (HFT) system** that integrates **FPGAs for real-time order execution** and **GPUs for risk modeling and market prediction**. The system is optimized to **execute trades within nanoseconds** by leveraging FPGA parallelism and GPU-accelerated inference.

## Features
- âš¡ **Nanosecond execution latency** with FPGA-optimized order book processing.
- ðŸš€ **CUDA-accelerated financial model inference** for market trend predictions.
- ðŸ”„ **PCIe optimization** for low-latency data transfer between FPGA, GPU, and CPU.
- ðŸ“‰ **Multi-asset arbitrage and strategy execution** with real-time computations.
- ðŸ”— **Integration with market feeds** (NASDAQ, CME, Binance API, etc.).

## Why Itâ€™s Hard
- **PCIe bottleneck**: GPUs excel at compute throughput but suffer from data transfer latency.
- **Shared memory contention**: FPGA, GPU, and CPU need optimized memory allocation.
- **Low-latency optimization**: Requires **CUDA streams & persistent kernels** to maintain a real-time trading pipeline.
